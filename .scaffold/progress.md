# Execution Progress

**Project:** pi-xai-oauth Repair + Tool Verification  
**Branch:** feature/xai-tools-all-verified  
**Started:** 2026-05-27

## Completed
- [x] Created branch `feature/improved-agent-scaffolding`
- [x] Ran parallel scout + researcher agents for context and 2026 best practices
- [x] Created `AGENTS.md` (production-ready agent operations manual)
- [x] Created `.scaffold/plan.md` (detailed implementation roadmap)
- [x] Created `.scaffold/constraints.md` (hard rules and safety gates)
- [x] Created `.scaffold/progress.md` (this file)

## In Progress
- [x] Enhance `bin/setup.js` with --scaffold flag + robust generation
- [x] Added context.md generation + generic templates
- [x] Updated README.md with Agent Scaffolding section
- [x] Reviewed and fixed minor consistency issues
- [x] Fixed CLI issues: duplicate headers, missing --help, improved arg parsing, dynamic branch detection, scaffold-specific header

## Next Actions
1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` (already clean)
2. [x] Test full --scaffold and --help flows (verified: clean output, no duplicates, new headers, skips existing files)
3. Run reviewer agent on changes
4. Commit with clear message
5. Consider creating a reusable scaffold template package

## Notes
This structure follows 2026 best practices: dedicated AGENTS.md, external persistent state, planning-first approach, and multi-agent delegation patterns.

Update this file frequently during execution.

## Phase 5: Multi-Agent Integration
- [ ] Document preferred subagent usage patterns in AGENTS.md
- [ ] Create lightweight `scaffold-starter` template
- [ ] Add reviewer step in workflow
- [ ] Test parallel/chain subagent delegation

## Phase 6: Provider Payload Hook Repair
- [x] Diagnosed pi 0.74 provider errors after skill install: `before_provider_request` returned `{ payload }` instead of the replacement payload directly.
- [x] Patched `extensions/xai-oauth.ts` so sanitized provider requests are returned in the shape pi expects.
- [x] Removed the redundant global provider request hook so xAI sanitation stays inside the xAI provider stream path and does not mutate DeepSeek/Codex payloads.
- [x] Reinstalled the local package, cleared pi's Jiti cache, and verified provider smoke tests:
  - xAI now reaches the xAI API and returns an account/subscription 403 instead of `missing field input`.
  - DeepSeek returns `OK` instead of `missing field messages`.
  - OpenAI Codex returns `OK` instead of rejecting model `None`.

**Current branch:** feature/multi-agent-integration

## Phase 7: xAI Auth + Tool Parity Repair
- [x] Created current repair branch `codex/repair-xai-auth` from the detached worktree.
- [x] Audited provider/OAuth and custom tool paths with parallel subagents.
- [x] Hardened OAuth callback state handling so wrong or missing browser callback state cannot complete login.
- [x] Refreshes reused Grok CLI credentials before accepting them, and rejects expired credentials that cannot refresh.
- [x] Keeps xAI encrypted reasoning continuity in Responses payloads and preserves reasoning effort for Grok 4.20 reasoning.
- [x] Updated Grok model metadata/pricing and added `grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309`.
- [x] Reworked custom xAI tools to resolve OAuth via pi's model registry, remove `XAI_API_KEY` fallback, pass cancellation signals, and use native xAI `web_search`, `x_search`, and `code_interpreter` tools.
- [x] Updated image analysis and image generation request shapes, including `grok-imagine-image-quality`.
- [x] Added `scripts/verify-extension.js` plus `npm test` / `npm run typecheck` scripts.
- [x] Fixed README/setup drift and backed up malformed pi settings before rewriting.
- [x] Addressed final review findings: reload-safe tool registration, automatic Grok 4.20 reasoning handling, and correct multi-agent effort/accounting.
- [x] Verified:
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm test`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `npm pack --dry-run`
  - `node bin/setup.js --help`
  - live local-extension DeepSeek smoke: `OK.`
  - live local-extension OpenAI Codex smoke: `OK`
  - live local-extension xAI smoke reaches xAI and returns account/subscription `403` instead of a payload/auth-shape error.

**Current branch:** codex/repair-xai-auth

## Phase 8: Post-Repair Tool Verification (this branch)
- [x] Synced local source to `codex/repair-xai-auth` (and main) via git setup
- [x] `npm install` + `npm test` ✅ (`verify-extension: ok`)
- [x] `pi install .` ✅
- [x] Verified all custom xAI tools via live calls:
  - `xai_x_search`, `xai_web_search`, `xai_critique`, `xai_generate_text` (grok-4.3 + reasoning), `xai_code_execution`
- [x] Confirmed OAuth provider, native tool shapes, no XAI_API_KEY fallback, and reasoning continuity all working
- [x] Initialized real git repo, switched to feature branch, updated docs
- [x] Working tree clean, up-to-date with `origin/main`

**Current branch:** feature/add-composer-2-5-models

## Phase 9: Add Composer 2.5 model selection
- [x] Created branch `feature/add-composer-2-5-models`.
- [x] Added `grok-composer-2.5-fast` and `grok-build` to the `xai-auth` provider model catalog.
- [x] Routed Grok CLI-only models through `https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1` with Grok CLI OAuth headers while keeping Grok 4.3/default models on `https://api.x.ai/v1`.
- [x] Updated custom tool request routing so `xai_generate_text` can use Composer 2.5/Grok Build model IDs.
- [x] Updated README/setup copy and verification coverage.
- [x] Added local `typescript` dev dependency so `npm run typecheck` resolves the real compiler and passes consistently.
- [x] Verified with `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `node bin/setup.js --help`, `git diff --check`, `npm pack --dry-run`, and `pi install .`.
- [x] Added README troubleshooting/updating guidance for duplicate npm/local/worktree installs causing `xai_*` tool conflicts.
- [x] Added Cursor/Grok CLI tool shims (`Read`, `Write`, `StrReplace`, `Edit`, `Delete`, `LS`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Shell`, `WebSearch`) for Composer 2.5/Grok Build and model-scoped activation.
- [x] Added verification for shim registration, activation/deactivation, argument normalization, and Grep/Glob/Read/Write/StrReplace/Shell/Delete execution.
- [x] Documented Composer/Grok Build tool compatibility in README.
